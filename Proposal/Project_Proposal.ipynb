    "- It explores the rare type of Neutron star that emits radio emission detected on Earth. Current research is based on space-time, interstellar medium and states of matter that produce emission beams of radiation as it crosses the path of Earth, and with pulsars rotation, a pattern occurs frequently. Each pulsar  emits a different type of emission pattern which means the emission variation can provide answers whether the pulsar is real or fake. \n",

The data set has 9 quantitative variables, which can be divided into two groups called Integrated Pulse Profile and DM-SNR Curve.
